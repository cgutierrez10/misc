Graphics:
sprite animation
pixel placement being more accurate
wave shader/pixel placement
To help with debugging create a bobber object, that draws sprite at level of physics waterline
   If these are aligned it can help with debugging shader pixels to wave physics

Physics:
wave jump physics

Gameplay:
Scoring for passed obstacles
