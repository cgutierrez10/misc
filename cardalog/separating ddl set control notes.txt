To separate the ddl control set as a separate control:

using existing code evaluate ways to making elements into useable iteratiable arrays that are simple to programatically interact with

find simple ways to populate the controls (maybe by each column in a datatable being uniquely bound to each control)

define ways to control the set of controls (size multi-select defaults etc)

determine how to load this control into VS as a drag and drop control

package control for distribution as desired


issues to avoid:
avoid worrying about column names and control titles try to make this entirely abstract

avoid edge cases of excessive controls (that's an implimentation problem on the user-dev not a control issue)

avoid any and all efforts to bind this to a datasource (at this time, as an evolution it may be handy or appropriate but KISS)
