An effort to list the target formats from which import should be possible along with the minimum data set required for the more flexible formats such as CSV's

CSV files must have:
player name
card number
manufacturer of card
year of publish

from this set an index value will be produced

CSV files may include:
locational data (physical storage): 3 dimension integer array; defaults to 0's
	Typical use in current practice is [binder][page][slot in card page]
	Use may be regarded as flexible but each field must be an integer
Image data: Binary data glob; defaults to null
	Not currently used in practice but the database format specifies a field
	for binary dataglobs
Value Data A: Float value from 0 to 1, defaults to 1
	This is a price multiplier attached to individual cards which represents
	values with specific quality data in mind, this is entered by the users opinion
	Defaults to 1 (100% of base value)
Value Data B: Float from 0 to inf
	This represents a base value of a card assuming a mint condition example.

et al continue editting later and expand this listing.

Additional targets, investigate the ability to export user data from becketts online catalogging resource

prepare xml transfer tool in an generic a way as possible


All import tools should include configure modes
	Read a single data row (as best as possible to determine)
	ask user to verify what type of data this field from row represents
	parse fields
